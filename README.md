## Password Cracking & PDF Password Security Lab



---

## 📌 Project Overview

As part of the **NetworkWalks Cybersecurity Internship — Batch B082, Week 03**, I performed a practical password-security lab using intentionally provided password-protected PDF files.

The lab focused on understanding how a password-protected PDF can be processed into a crackable hash representation and how password-recovery tools can be used in an **authorized educational environment**.

###  Practical Modules

| Module | Activity | Main Tool |
|---|---|---|
|  W3-PM1 | Password cracking / JTR setup | John the Ripper / Johnny |
|  W3-PM2 | PDF hash extraction | NetworkWalks Hash Calculator |
|  W3-PM2 | Dictionary-based password testing | NetworkWalks Password Cracker |
|  Verification | Open and verify the protected PDF | PDF Reader |

---

##  Objectives

- Understand password-protected PDF files.
- Learn the role of password hashes in password-security testing.
- Configure and use **John the Ripper / Johnny**.
- Extract a PDF hash in a compatible format.
- Perform dictionary-based password testing in a controlled lab.
- Verify the recovered password against the provided PDF.
- Understand the importance of strong and unique passwords.
- Document practical cybersecurity work with screenshots and evidence.

##  Ethical & Authorized Use

>  **AUTHORIZED EDUCATIONAL LAB ONLY**
>
> All activities documented in this repository were performed for cybersecurity learning and practical training using intentionally provided laboratory material.
>
> Password-recovery techniques should only be used on files, systems, or accounts for which you have explicit authorization.

#  W3-PM1 — John the Ripper / Johnny

## 1. John the Ripper Configuration

Johnny was configured to use the installed **John the Ripper Jumbo** executable.

The configuration screen confirms that the JTR executable was detected successfully.

### 📸 Evidence

#  W3-PM2 — PDF Hash Extraction

## 2. Extracting the PDF Hash

The password-protected PDF was processed using a PDF hash-extraction tool.

The resulting output was presented in a format compatible with password-auditing tools such as **John the Ripper** and **Hashcat**.

### 📸 Evidence

#  NetworkWalks Hash Calculator

## 3. Hash Calculator

The NetworkWalks Hash Calculator was used to analyze the protected PDF and generate a crackable PDF hash representation.

The tool identified the PDF as encrypted and displayed the extracted hash.

### 📸 Evidence

#  NetworkWalks Password Cracker

## 4. Dictionary-Based Password Testing

The extracted PDF hash was supplied to the NetworkWalks Password Cracker.

The tool tested candidate passwords from a dictionary and identified a successful match.

### 📸 Evidence

### ✅ Result

**Password successfully recovered in the authorized lab environment.**

> For security and responsible-publication purposes, the recovered password is intentionally not reproduced in this README.

#  PDF Verification & Flag

## 5. Password Verification

After successful password recovery, the protected PDF was opened and verified.

The lab PDF displayed a successful completion message and a captured flag.

#  Key Learning Outcomes

Through this practical, I gained hands-on understanding of:

-  Password security
-  PDF hash extraction
-  Hash formats
-  John the Ripper / Johnny
-  Dictionary-based password testing
-  Security-tool configuration
-  Password-protected PDF analysis
-  Practical password auditing
-  Evidence collection
-  Cybersecurity documentation
-  Ethical security testing

#  Password Security Takeaways

### 1. Use Strong Passwords
Simple and predictable passwords are more susceptible to dictionary-based recovery.

### 2. Avoid Password Reuse
Using the same password across multiple resources increases the potential impact of password compromise.

### 3. Protect Password Hashes
Password hashes should be treated as sensitive security information because they may be targeted by offline password-recovery techniques.

### 4. Test Only With Authorization
Password auditing should only be performed against systems or files where explicit permission has been granted.
